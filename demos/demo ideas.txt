                           Ideas for Fran Demos

There are two main purposes for choosing good demos.  First, they will
help to convey to people (DA team, graphics folks, language folks, ...)
why they would be interested in adopting some of the semantic and
implementation ideas or even something like Haskell and Fran.  Second,
they will focus our limited R&D resources.

Make sure to show well-factored (hierarchical and parametric) state
machines that exhibits complex behavior.

The demo ideas:

  - 3D rolodex-style information access.  Or file folder.  When selected,
    bring smoothly out of container, while opening up to reveal more
    information.  Closes and returns to container when told to.  What
    information?

  - Robot wars.  Let people program their own robots and have them
    battle.  Depends on well-defined Robot interface.

  - Lemmings.  Could also be extensible.  Maybe throw in reproduction.

  - Author new agents for MS Agent.

  - Asteroids: enemies, multi-player, multi-level, top scores list.  VB-
    or MFC-based UI.

  - Simple strategy games, user vs computer.

  - Maze-wandering game, including treasures, keys and autonomous
    monsters.  VB- or MFC-based UI.  Save & restore game.

  - A simple editor, say for curves or animations.  Emphasize
    multi-lingual integration.  The general idea would be to do the UI and
    application structure with VB, but media and animation stuff with
    Fran.  Handle all raw UI in VB, turning them into higher level
    animation events, such as, grabControlPoint.

  - Springs-and-balls assembly kit.  Users may add or remove pieces,
    change masses and stiffnesses, and activate/deactivate visualization of
    force, acceleration, velocity vectors, or spring displacements.

  - Multi-view editing, starting with color widgets.  The Brown U guys
    couldn't figure out how to do it with DA, and think constraints may be
    necessary.  [Challenges: simulate multi-directional constraints;
    spatially modular interaction.]

  - Fish tank simulation with prey and predators.  New
    inhabitants may be added at any time, via GUI.  Abilities:
    + Vision, and some form of discrimination about what is seen, such as
      distance and species.
    + Hunger, and knowledge of prey/predator.
    + Turning and propulsion (motivated by hunger, vision, and prey/predator
      knowledge).
    + Eating & being eaten
    + Maybe strength and max speed

  - Dogz & Catz (http://www.pfmagic.com).  Give each a variety of
    behaviors (eating, sleeping, exploration) in addition to their
    interactions, to illustrate compositional construction of complex
    multi-phase behavior.  Users can provide food, play, bedding,
    transportation, and open & close doors.

  - Persona-based UI.
