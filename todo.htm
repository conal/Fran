<h1 align="center">RBMH Release To Do List</h1>

<ul>
    <li>More interesting demos. </li>
    <li>Restore interval analysis and <strong>predicate</strong>.</li>
    <li>Use strictness annotations for vector, point, and
        transform types. </li>
    <li>Figure out why the <strong>lotus</strong> examples in <strong>ImageTest</strong>.hs
        are so slow. </li>
    <li>Figure out why <strong>iBlowStack</strong> blows the
        control stack.</li>
    <li>Re-implement external events so that behaviors built out
        of them time-transform well. (See the motion tracker examples
        in <strong>ImageBTest.hs</strong>.)</li>
    <li>Re-introduce sound. It's been implemented previously, and
        so shouldn't be hard to do again. I want to embed sound
        in images, with simple stereo rendering. </li>
    <li>Do image presentation through <em>DirectDraw</em>, which
        will speed things up if you have a good video card.
        Again, this has been done in a previous version, so should
        be coming soon. </li>
    <li>Add 3D. For performance, use Direct3D's retained mode. </li>
    <li>Define precise semantics for Image type and its
        operations, independent of representation/construction.
        For instance, make sure that coloring and transformation work sensibly
        to bitmap- and text-based images. </li>
    <li>Short operator names for point/vector/scalar operations
        instead of <strong>pointMinusPoint2</strong>, for instance. </li>
    <li>Restore <strong>when</strong> and image picking.</li>
    <li>Re-introduce &quot;interactive images&quot;. </li>
    <li>Switch color animations to use HSL. </li>
    <li>Make modules selective about exports. I got lazy. </li>
    <li>Check names for consistency with <em>ActiveX Animation</em>
        and update exhaustive catalog of differences. </li>
    <li>Use bounding boxes pervasively in rendering. Define a
        function <strong>easyBBox :: Image -&gt; Maybe (Point2, Point2)</strong>
        that picks off the easy cases: <strong>Circle</strong>, <strong>Square</strong>, <strong>Bitmap</strong>, <strong>Bezier</strong>, <strong>Text</strong>,
        and <strong>BBoxed2</strong>. </li>
    <li>Avoid off-window rendering, using bounding box. </li>
    <li>Subtler: avoid rendering fully occluded images. </li>
    <li>Optimize bitmap drawing to use <strong>BitBlt</strong>
        where applicable. </li>
</ul>
