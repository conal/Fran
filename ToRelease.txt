- Update newFran.htm in FrontPage.  Change the version number and the
  "Grab the file _here_" link.  Save.  Let the web-bot change the edited
  date.

- Do a recursive SourceSafe check-in at the Fran1 level.

- Do a recursive SourceSafe "get" to a directory ToZip\Fran1, setting the
  file dates to "modified", in the advanced controls for "get".

- Copy Fran1\SpriteLib\src\Debug\SpriteLib.dll to ToZip\Fran1.  Copy
  HSpriteLib.dll and HSpriteLib.hs from Fran1\SpriteLib\src to
  ToZip\Fran1\src.

- Make a new file, like "Fran1.04.zip" in ToZip; open it; and do a
  recursive wildcard add.

- Copy the new zip file and newFran.htm to my fran web directory.

- Verify that it works, by following the link from my external web page:
  http://www.research.microsoft.com/~conal/fran/newFran.htm. 

- Assuming it works, do a SourceSafe "label" to the Fran pjt.

- Put out the word.
