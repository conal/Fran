- Update newFran.htm.  Change the version number, date and download link.
  Save.

- Do a recursive SourceSafe check-in at the Fran1 level.

- Do a recursive SourceSafe "get" to a directory ToZip\Fran1, setting the
  file dates to "modified", in the advanced controls for "get".

- Delete files from ToZip\Fran1 that should not go into the release.
  Currently, just src\Makefile (for GHC).

- Copy Fran1\SpriteLib\src\Debug\SpriteLib.dll and gc\HSpriteLib.dll and
  gc\HSpriteLib.hs to ToZip\Fran1\gc. 

- Make a new file, like "Fran1.04.zip" in ToZip; open it; and do a
  recursive wildcard add.

- Copy the new zip file and ToZip\Fran1\*.htm and *.gif to my fran web
  directory.

- Verify that it works, by following the link from my external web page:
  http://www.research.microsoft.com/~conal/fran. 

- Assuming it works, do a SourceSafe "label" to the Fran project.

- Put out the word.
