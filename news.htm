<h1 align="center">News on Recent RBMH Releases</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a href="http:rbmh0.0.zip">0.0</a> Sept 8, 1996</h2>

<ul>
    <li>First release </li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="http:rbmh0.1.zip">0.1</a> Sept 9, 1996</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Fixed inverse2 bug that messed up screen-to-world mapping </li>
    <li>Fixed RenderImage.draw to catch all errors and print
        &quot;Win32 drawing error&quot; instead of bombing. When
        you start seeing this message, you can kill the animation window. </li>
    <li>Changed ImageBTest.smoothGrowShrink to scale by &quot;exp
        (integral (changingRate t0) t0&quot; instead of &quot;1 + integral
        (changingRate t0) t0&quot;. The result looks better the
        new way and never does negative scaling. </li>
    <li>Added a bunch of fun examples to ImageBTest. These
        examples are eyes that look at the mouse and one that chases
        it. See i12 to i16. </li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="http:rbmh0.2.zip">0.2</a> Sept 16, 1996</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Added timeTransform to Behavior.hs. Warning: the
        implementation of untilB assumes that the given time
        stream does not go backwards across events. We cannot
        guarantee this property, so be careful! Before, we've
        said to use only monotically non-decreasing time transforms,
        but non-monotonic ones are very useful at times, and untilB
        is the only construct that has trouble with them. (Even integration
        doesn't mind.) </li>
    <li>Changed ImageTest.lotus to take take the number of rings
        as an argument, rather than doing using many of them.
        Added example ImageBTest.i18 to show it off. Still pretty slow.
        :-(</li>
    <li>Major change to the representation of events.</li>
    <li>Added some neat examples of Sigbjorn's, involving time
        transforms. See i19, i20, and i21 in ImageBTest.hs. Unfortunately,
        time transformation works badly with external events, and
        thus with the mouse position behavior, to i20 and i21 are quite jerky.</li>
    <li>Renamed constructors Vector2 and Point2 to Vector2XY and
        Point2XY.</li>
    <li>Re-implemented integral so that recursive systems (ODEs)
        work efficiently! Try &quot;disp (i17 0)&quot; in ImageBTest, and
        move the mouse around. The eyes are connected in a chain
        of springs. Introduced the t0 argument to to avoid a
        space leak problem. This change should be done throughout
        ImageBTest.</li>
    <li>Removed determinant common-subexpression from inverse2.</li>
    <li>Renamed lerp2 to linearInterpolate2.</li>
    <li>Added RBMH module, which imports all the individual parts
        of RBMH, and reexports those appropriate for a casual
        user. (Thanks go to Alastair Reid for these last three
        items.)</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="http:rbmh0.3.zip">0.3</a> Sept 17, 1996</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Added <strong>StaticTypes</strong> module, which just
        packages up the static modeling types. Recommended use:
        &quot;<strong>import qualified StaticTypes as S</strong>&quot;.
        (As in <strong>ImageBTest.hs</strong>.)</li>
    <li>Added <strong>predicate</strong> for events based on
        boolean behaviors.</li>
    <li>Added bouncing ball examples <strong>i23</strong> and <strong>i24</strong>
        to <strong>ImageBTest.hs</strong>. For <strong>i24</strong>,
        do a left-click to add a new ball. They disappear after
        five seconds.</li>
    <li>Switched all <strong>ImageBTest</strong> examples to be
        functions of start time, to eliminate space leak (CAFs) and
        to make them temporally composable.</li>
    <li>Added keyboard event primitives <strong>primKP</strong>
        and <strong>primKR</strong> in <strong>PrimInteract.hs</strong>,
        plus a higher-level version <strong>keyPress</strong> in <strong>Interaction.hs</strong>.
        Changed <strong>i8</strong> in <strong>ImageBTest</strong>
        to use it.</li>
    <li>Added <strong>allDemos</strong> to <strong>ImageBTest</strong>.
        This new &quot;super demo&quot; combines all of the
        others. run &quot;<strong>disp allDemos</strong>&quot; to
        see them all, and press &lt;space&gt; to go on to the
        next item.</li>
    <li>Added lifted list formation and extraction: <strong>nilB,
        consB, headB, tailB</strong>.</li>
</ul>
