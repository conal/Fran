<h2><a href="http:rbmh0.0.zip">0.0</a> Sept 8, 1996</h2>

<ul>
    <li>First release </li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="http:rbmh0.1.zip">0.1</a> Sept 9, 1996</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Fixed inverse2 bug that messed up screen-to-world mapping </li>
    <li>Fixed RenderImage.draw to catch all errors and print
        &quot;Win32 drawing error&quot; instead of bombing. When
        you start seeing this message, you can kill the animation window. </li>
    <li>Changed ImageBTest.smoothGrowShrink to scale by &quot;exp
        (integral (changingRate t0) t0&quot; instead of &quot;1 + integral
        (changingRate t0) t0&quot;. The result looks better the new
        way and never does negative scaling. </li>
    <li>Added a bunch of fun examples to ImageBTest. These
        examples are eyes that look at the mouse and one that chases
        it. See i12 to i16. </li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="http:rbmh0.2.zip">0.2</a> Sept 16, 1996</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Added timeTransform to Behavior.hs. Warning: the
        implementation of untilB assumes that the given time
        stream does not go backwards across events. We cannot
        guarantee this property, so be careful! Before, we've
        said to use only monotically non-decreasing time
        transforms, but non-monotonic ones are very useful at
        times, and untilB is the only construct that has trouble
        with them. (Even integration doesn't mind.) </li>
    <li>Changed ImageTest.lotus to take take the number of rings
        as an argument, rather than doing using many of them.
        Added example ImageBTest.i18 to show it off. Still pretty
        slow. :-(</li>
    <li>Major change to the representation of events.</li>
    <li>Added some neat examples of Sigbjorn's, involving time
        transforms. See i19, i20, and i21 in ImageBTest.hs. Unfortunately,
        time transformation works badly with external events, and
        thus with the mouse position behavior, to i20 and i21 are
        quite jerky.</li>
    <li>Renamed constructors Vector2 and Point2 to Vector2XY and
        Point2XY.</li>
    <li>Re-implemented integral so that recursive systems (ODEs)
        work efficiently! Try &quot;disp (i17 0)&quot; in
        ImageBTest, and move the mouse around. The eyes are connected
        in a chain of springs. Introduced the t0 argument to to avoid
        a space leak problem. This change should be done
        throughout ImageBTest.</li>
    <li>Removed determinant common-subexpression from inverse2.</li>
    <li>Renamed lerp2 to linearInterpolate2.</li>
    <li>Added RBMH module, which imports all the individual parts
        of RBMH, and reexports those appropriate for a casual
        user. (Thanks go to Alastair Reid for these last three
        items.)</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="http:rbmh0.3.zip">0.3</a> Sept 17, 1996</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Added <strong>StaticTypes</strong> module, which just
        packages up the static modeling types. Recommended use:
        &quot;<strong>import qualified StaticTypes as S</strong>&quot;.
        (As in <strong>ImageBTest.hs</strong>.)</li>
    <li>Added <strong>predicate</strong> for events based on
        boolean behaviors.</li>
    <li>Added bouncing ball examples <strong>i23</strong> and <strong>i24</strong>
        to <strong>ImageBTest.hs</strong>. For <strong>i24</strong>,
        do a left-click to add a new ball. They disappear after
        five seconds.</li>
    <li>Switched all <strong>ImageBTest</strong> examples to be
        functions of start time, to eliminate space leak (CAFs)
        and to make them temporally composable.</li>
    <li>Added keyboard event primitives <strong>primKP</strong>
        and <strong>primKR</strong> in <strong>PrimInteract.hs</strong>, plus a
        higher-level version <strong>keyPress</strong> in <strong>Interaction.hs</strong>.
        Changed <strong>i8</strong> in <strong>ImageBTest</strong>
        to use it.</li>
    <li>Added <strong>allDemos</strong> to <strong>ImageBTest</strong>.
        This new &quot;super demo&quot; combines all of the others.
        run &quot;<strong>disp allDemos</strong>&quot; to see
        them all, and press &lt;space&gt; to go on to the next
        item.</li>
    <li>Added lifted list formation and extraction: <strong>nilB,
        consB, headB, tailB</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="http:rbmh0.4.zip">0.4</a> Sept 20, 1996</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Changed <strong>polyline</strong> from being a filled
        polygon to be a set of connected line segments. Added <strong>polygon</strong>
        for describing n-sided filled polygons. The inside of a polygon
        is filled with the (outermost) color specified with the <strong>withColor</strong> combinator,
        i.e., <tt>withColor red (polygon ls)</tt> draws a red
        polygon. (default is white). Line segments are drawn with
        a white pen.</li>
    <li>Switched color transformation combinators from using RGB
        color space to HSL (removed mixRed,mixGreen,mixBlue).</li>
    <li>Added a fourth control point argument to <strong>bezier</strong>,
        instead of having the origin2 be the implicit first
        control point.</li>
    <li>Added a bunch of demos that uses <strong>polyline</strong>, <strong>polygon</strong>
        and <strong>bezier</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="http:rbmh0.5.zip">0.5</a> Oct 8, 1996</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Added <strong>pairBSplit</strong> for taking apart
        pair-valued behaviors. Sample use:<br>
        (wWidth, wHeight) = pairBSplit (vector2XYCoords <em>aVecBehavior</em>)</li>
    <li>Added projects.htm, listing non-trivial RBMH-related
        projects.</li>
    <li>Fixed error in <strong>interpolateColor</strong> found by
        Gary Shu Ling. </li>
    <li>Added ^* and ^^*, lifted versions of ^ and ^^. Added
        lifted ^ and ^^ (exponentiation).</li>
    <li>Added +, -, and negate on vectors (via a <strong>Num</strong>
        instance).</li>
    <li>Fixed the view transformation so that the origin is
        always in the window center. (!)</li>
    <li>Added a frame to the bouncy ball examples <strong>i23</strong>
        and <strong>i24</strong>.</li>
    <li>Added a lot of number operator overloadings and
        functions, and checked in <strong>Behavior.hs</strong>.
        Several couldn't be lifted because of their types, and so
        have names like &quot;<strong>roundB</strong>&quot;
        instead of &quot;<strong>round</strong>&quot;. If you try
        using something like &quot;<strong>round</strong>&quot;, you'll
        get a helpful error message.</li>
    <li>Added <strong>dispFps</strong> to ImageBTest.hs. This
        variant of <strong>disp</strong> shows the frames per second.</li>
    <li>Re-activated frames-per-second counting. See <strong>dispFps</strong>
        in <strong>ImageBTest.hs</strong>.</li>
    <li>Added <strong>showB</strong>, a lifting of <strong>show</strong>.</li>
    <li>Integrated Gary's fix for <strong>viewSize</strong>
        behavior.</li>
    <li>Added example <strong>i37</strong> showing a use of <strong>viewSize</strong>
        to stretch an image to fit the window, based on a similar function
        of Gary's.</li>
    <li>Added a frog image <strong>Media\frog.bmp</strong> from <a
        href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/sjl/froggy.html">Sandra
        Loosemore's frog page</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="http:rbmh0.6.zip">0.6</a> Oct 25, 1996</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Changed several of the examples in <strong>ImageBTest.hs</strong>
        to use the <font face="Courier New"><strong>*=&gt;</strong></font>
        operator, whose second argument consumes just the event
        time, ignoring the data.</li>
    <li>Added <strong>regularPolygon</strong> and <strong>star</strong>
        in <strong>Image.hs</strong> and <strong>ImageB.hs</strong>.</li>
    <li>Added <strong>bounce1'</strong>, a new version of <strong>bounce</strong>1,
        in <strong>ImageBTest.hs</strong>. The new one is simpler,
        but doesn't yet work, probably because of too much
        self-reactivity (snapshotting and/or predicate).</li>
    <li>Added <strong>UtilsB.hs</strong>. Ad hoc collection of
        definitions. These are here for introductory use, to make
        it easier to do some simple things. I'd like to make it so
        that kids can use this simple vocabulary.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="http:rbmh0.7.zip">0.7</a> Oct ??, 1996</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Re-introduced Sigbjorn's monadic event combinators. See
        especially &gt;&gt;, &gt;&gt;=, +&gt;&gt;=, and
        joinEvent. These are very useful and complement the
        previous set. The event combinators <strong>suchThat</strong>
        and <strong>filterEv</strong>, which were previously
        primitive, are now derived. Even <strong>predicate</strong>
        is defined in terms of &gt;&gt;. (Interval analysis still not restored.) <em>Check
        it out!</em></li>
    <li>Big change in representation of behaviors and events. A
        behavior is no longer maps time streams to value streams,
        but rather maps a single time to a value and a new behavior.
        Simon PJ recommended this representation as being neatly deforestable by
        GHC. (Sigbjorn also suggested it a while back.)
        Similarly, an event takes a query time tq and returns
        either a time/value pair (te,x) with te&lt;tq, or a new
        event (non-occurrence).</li>
    <li>Rewrote <strong>integral</strong> to be a recursive
        reactive behavior. Still uses Euler's method :-( but now
        is piecewise-linear between steps.</li>
</ul>
