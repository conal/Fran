<h1 align="center">News on Recent RBMH Releases</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>0.0 Sept 8, 1996</h2>

<ul>
    <li>First release </li>
</ul>

<h2>0.1 Sept 9, 1996</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Fixed inverse2 bug that messed up screen-to-world mapping </li>
    <li>Fixed RenderImage.draw to catch all errors and print
        &quot;Win32 drawing error&quot; instead of bombing. When
        you stat seeing this message, you can kill the animation window. </li>
    <li>Changed ImageBTest.smoothGrowShrink to scale by &quot;exp
        (integral (changingRate t0) t0&quot; instead of &quot;1 +
        integral (changingRate t0) t0&quot;. The result looks
        better the new way and never does negative scaling. </li>
    <li>Added a bunch of fun examples to ImageBTest. These
        examples are eyes that look at the mouse and one that
        chases it. See i12 to i16. </li>
</ul>

<h2>0.2 Sept 16, 1996</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Added timeTransform to Behavior.hs. Warning: the
        implementation of untilB assumes that the given time
        stream does not go backwards across events. We cannot
        guarantee this property, so be careful! Before, we've
        said to use only monotically non-decreasing time transforms,
        but non-monotonic ones are very useful at times, and
        untilB is the only construct that has trouble with them.
        (Even integration doesn't mind.) </li>
    <li>Changed ImageTest.lotus to take take the number of rings
        as an argument, rather than doing using many of them.
        Added example ImageBTest.i18 to show it off. Still pretty slow.
        :-(</li>
    <li>Major change to the representation of events.</li>
    <li>Added some neat examples of Sigbjorn's, involving time
        transforms. See i19, i20, and i21 in ImageBTest.hs.
        Unfortunately, time transformation works badly with external events,
        and thus with the mouse position behavior, to i20 and i21 are quite jerky.</li>
    <li>Renamed constructors Vector2 and Point2 to Vector2XY and
        Point2XY.</li>
    <li>Re-implemented integral so that recursive systems (ODEs)
        work efficiently! Try &quot;disp (i17 0)&quot; in ImageBTest,
        and move the mouse around. The eyes are connected in a
        chain of springs. Introduced the t0 argument to to avoid
        a space leak problem. This change should be done
        throughout ImageBTest.</li>
    <li>Removed determinant common-subexpression from inverse2.</li>
    <li>Renamed lerp2 to linearInterpolate2.</li>
    <li>Added RBMH module, which imports all the individual parts
        of RBMH, and reexports those appropriate for a casual
        user. (Thanks go to Alastair Reid for these last three
        items.)</li>
</ul>
