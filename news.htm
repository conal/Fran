<h2><a href="http:rbmh0.0.zip">0.0</a> Sept 8, 1996</h2>

<ul>
    <li>First release </li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="http:rbmh0.1.zip">0.1</a> Sept 9, 1996</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Fixed inverse2 bug that messed up screen-to-world mapping
    </li>
    <li>Fixed RenderImage.draw to catch all errors and print
        &quot;Win32 drawing error&quot; instead of bombing. When
        you start seeing this message, you can kill the animation
        window. </li>
    <li>Changed ImageBTest.smoothGrowShrink to scale by &quot;exp
        (integral (changingRate t0) t0&quot; instead of &quot;1 +
        integral (changingRate t0) t0&quot;. The result looks
        better the new way and never does negative scaling. </li>
    <li>Added a bunch of fun examples to ImageBTest. These
        examples are eyes that look at the mouse and one that
        chases it. See i12 to i16. </li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="http:rbmh0.2.zip">0.2</a> Sept 16, 1996</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Added timeTransform to Behavior.hs. Warning: the
        implementation of untilB assumes that the given time
        stream does not go backwards across events. We cannot
        guarantee this property, so be careful! Before, we've
        said to use only monotically non-decreasing time
        transforms, but non-monotonic ones are very useful at
        times, and untilB is the only construct that has trouble
        with them. (Even integration doesn't mind.) </li>
    <li>Changed ImageTest.lotus to take take the number of rings
        as an argument, rather than doing using many of them.
        Added example ImageBTest.i18 to show it off. Still pretty
        slow. :-(</li>
    <li>Major change to the representation of events.</li>
    <li>Added some neat examples of Sigbjorn's, involving time
        transforms. See i19, i20, and i21 in ImageBTest.hs.
        Unfortunately, time transformation works badly with
        external events, and thus with the mouse position
        behavior, to i20 and i21 are quite jerky.</li>
    <li>Renamed constructors Vector2 and Point2 to Vector2XY and
        Point2XY.</li>
    <li>Re-implemented integral so that recursive systems (ODEs)
        work efficiently! Try &quot;disp (i17 0)&quot; in
        ImageBTest, and move the mouse around. The eyes are
        connected in a chain of springs. Introduced the t0
        argument to to avoid a space leak problem. This change
        should be done throughout ImageBTest.</li>
    <li>Removed determinant common-subexpression from inverse2.</li>
    <li>Renamed lerp2 to linearInterpolate2.</li>
    <li>Added RBMH module, which imports all the individual parts
        of RBMH, and reexports those appropriate for a casual
        user. (Thanks go to Alastair Reid for these last three
        items.)</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="http:rbmh0.3.zip">0.3</a> Sept 17, 1996</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Added <strong>StaticTypes</strong> module, which just
        packages up the static modeling types. Recommended use:
        &quot;<strong>import qualified StaticTypes as S</strong>&quot;.
        (As in <strong>ImageBTest.hs</strong>.)</li>
    <li>Added <strong>predicate</strong> for events based on
        boolean behaviors.</li>
    <li>Added bouncing ball examples <strong>i23</strong> and <strong>i24</strong>
        to <strong>ImageBTest.hs</strong>. For <strong>i24</strong>,
        do a left-click to add a new ball. They disappear after
        five seconds.</li>
    <li>Switched all <strong>ImageBTest</strong> examples to be
        functions of start time, to eliminate space leak (CAFs)
        and to make them temporally composable.</li>
    <li>Added keyboard event primitives <strong>primKP</strong>
        and <strong>primKR</strong> in <strong>PrimInteract.hs</strong>,
        plus a higher-level version <strong>keyPress</strong> in <strong>Interaction.hs</strong>.
        Changed <strong>i8</strong> in <strong>ImageBTest</strong>
        to use it.</li>
    <li>Added <strong>allDemos</strong> to <strong>ImageBTest</strong>.
        This new &quot;super demo&quot; combines all of the
        others. run &quot;<strong>disp allDemos</strong>&quot; to
        see them all, and press &lt;space&gt; to go on to the
        next item.</li>
    <li>Added lifted list formation and extraction: <strong>nilB,
        consB, headB, tailB</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="http:rbmh0.4.zip">0.4</a> Sept 20, 1996</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Changed <strong>polyline</strong> from being a filled
        polygon to be a set of connected line segments. Added <strong>polygon</strong>
        for describing n-sided filled polygons. The inside of a
        polygon is filled with the (outermost) color specified
        with the <strong>withColor</strong> combinator, i.e., <tt>withColor
        red (polygon ls)</tt> draws a red polygon. (default is
        white). Line segments are drawn with a white pen.</li>
    <li>Switched color transformation combinators from using RGB
        color space to HSL (removed mixRed,mixGreen,mixBlue).</li>
    <li>Added a fourth control point argument to <strong>bezier</strong>,
        instead of having the origin2 be the implicit first
        control point.</li>
    <li>Added a bunch of demos that uses <strong>polyline</strong>,
        <strong>polygon</strong> and <strong>bezier</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="http:rbmh0.5.zip">0.5</a> Oct 8, 1996</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Added <strong>pairBSplit</strong> for taking apart
        pair-valued behaviors. Sample use:<br>
        (wWidth, wHeight) = pairBSplit (vector2XYCoords <em>aVecBehavior</em>)</li>
    <li>Added projects.htm, listing non-trivial RBMH-related
        projects.</li>
    <li>Fixed error in <strong>interpolateColor</strong> found by
        Gary Shu Ling. </li>
    <li>Added ^* and ^^*, lifted versions of ^ and ^^. Added
        lifted ^ and ^^ (exponentiation).</li>
    <li>Added +, -, and negate on vectors (via a <strong>Num</strong>
        instance).</li>
    <li>Fixed the view transformation so that the origin is
        always in the window center. (!)</li>
    <li>Added a frame to the bouncy ball examples <strong>i23</strong>
        and <strong>i24</strong>.</li>
    <li>Added a lot of number operator overloadings and
        functions, and checked in <strong>Behavior.hs</strong>.
        Several couldn't be lifted because of their types, and so
        have names like &quot;<strong>roundB</strong>&quot;
        instead of &quot;<strong>round</strong>&quot;. If you try
        using something like &quot;<strong>round</strong>&quot;,
        you'll get a helpful error message.</li>
    <li>Added <strong>dispFps</strong> to ImageBTest.hs. This
        variant of <strong>disp</strong> shows the frames per
        second.</li>
    <li>Re-activated frames-per-second counting. See <strong>dispFps</strong>
        in <strong>ImageBTest.hs</strong>.</li>
    <li>Added <strong>showB</strong>, a lifting of <strong>show</strong>.</li>
    <li>Integrated Gary's fix for <strong>viewSize</strong>
        behavior.</li>
    <li>Added example <strong>i37</strong> showing a use of <strong>viewSize</strong>
        to stretch an image to fit the window, based on a similar
        function of Gary's.</li>
    <li>Added a frog image <strong>Media\frog.bmp</strong> from <a
        href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/sjl/froggy.html">Sandra
        Loosemore's frog page</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="http:rbmh0.6.zip">0.6</a> Oct 25, 1996</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Changed several of the examples in <strong>ImageBTest.hs</strong>
        to use the <font face="Courier New"><strong>*=&gt;</strong></font>
        operator, whose second argument consumes just the event
        time, ignoring the data.</li>
    <li>Added <strong>regularPolygon</strong> and <strong>star</strong>
        in <strong>Image.hs</strong> and <strong>ImageB.hs</strong>.</li>
    <li>Added <strong>bounce1'</strong>, a new version of <strong>bounce</strong>1,
        in <strong>ImageBTest.hs</strong>. The new one is
        simpler, but doesn't yet work, probably because of too
        much self-reactivity (snapshotting and/or predicate).</li>
    <li>Added <strong>UtilsB.hs</strong>. Ad hoc collection of
        definitions. These are here for introductory use, to make
        it easier to do some simple things. I'd like to make it
        so that kids can use this simple vocabulary.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="http:rbmh0.7.zip">0.7</a> Oct 25, 1996</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Re-introduced Sigbjorn's monadic event combinators. See
        especially &gt;&gt;, &gt;&gt;=, +&gt;&gt;=, and
        joinEvent. These are very useful and complement the
        previous set. The event combinators <strong>suchThat</strong>
        and <strong>filterEv</strong>, which were previously
        primitive, are now derived. Even <strong>predicate</strong>
        is defined in terms of &gt;&gt;. (Interval analysis still
        not restored.) <em>Check it out!</em></li>
    <li>Big change in representation of behaviors and events. A
        behavior is no longer maps time streams to value streams,
        but rather maps a single time to a value and a new
        behavior. Simon PJ recommended this representation as
        being neatly deforestable by GHC. (Sigbjorn also
        suggested it a while back.) Similarly, an event takes a
        query time tq and returns either a time/value pair (te,x)
        with te&lt;tq, or a new event (non-occurrence).</li>
    <li>Rewrote <strong>integral</strong> to be a recursive
        reactive behavior. Still uses Euler's method :-( but now
        is piecewise-linear between steps.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="http:rbmh0.8patched.zip">0.8</a> Oct 31, 1996</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Made this version just before giving a talk at the Oregon
        Center for Advanced Technology Education (OCATE).</li>
    <li>Added a few small images to <strong>Media\</strong>,
        thanks to <a href="http://www.pixelmonkey.com/">Pixel
        Monkey</a>.</li>
    <li>A bunch of new examples in a new source file <strong>Samples.hs</strong>.
        These are the OCATE talk examples. Try them out!</li>
    <li>Added <strong>Force.hs</strong>, which defines a <strong>Forceable</strong>
        type class. Helps when lazy evaluation causes space
        leaks(Anthony Daniels)</li>
    <li>More helper functions in <strong>UtilsB.hs</strong>: <strong>TurnRight,
        TurnLeft,</strong> <strong>move</strong>, <strong>biggerXY</strong>,
        <strong>smallerXY</strong>, and <strong>wiggleRange</strong>.
        Removed <strong>moveHorizontal</strong> and <strong>moveVertical</strong>.
        Removed color from the <strong>showIm</strong> functions.
        Added <strong>atRate</strong> (synonym for <strong>integral</strong>).
    </li>
    <li>Added point and vector operation synonyms. .+^ .-., *^,
        and ^/.</li>
    <li>Text display now centers.</li>
    <li>Text now scales and rotates properly !!!</li>
    <li>Made default font be times roman, rather than
        &quot;system&quot;</li>
    <li>Noticed that <strong>i21</strong>, <strong>i22</strong>
        now work nicely. Sigbjorn made these ones, and apparently
        the version 0.7 changes let them work properly. Try them
        -- they're delightful!</li>
    <li>Added <strong>lbr</strong>, <strong>rbr</strong>, and
        simplified <strong>lbp</strong> and <strong>rbp</strong></li>
    <li>Doubled pixels-per-unit. You'll notice that the demo
        window is now bigger.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="http:rbmh0.81.zip">0.81</a> Nov 11, 1996</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Integrated lots of changes from <a
        href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/HTML/YALE/CS/HyPlans/reid-alastair.html">Alastair
        Reid</a>. He updated rbmh to a newer Hugs version, and
        making various improvements, and rewriting <strong>PrimInteract.hs</strong>
        to be much simpler. (Thanks, Alastair!!)</li>
    <li>Turned <strong>Samples.hs</strong> into a literate
        program, <strong>Tutorial.lhs</strong> with lots of
        prose. Please try it out and let me know what you think.</li>
    <li>Re-introduced fuzzy/interval analysis, and reimplemented <strong>predicate</strong>
        to use it. Renamed old version to <strong>predicate'</strong>.
        It's still useful because <strong>predicate</strong>
        doesn't handle <strong>untilB</strong> and (thus) <strong>integral</strong>
        yet.</li>
    <li>Replaced point and vector arithmetic names with
        operators, based on the names that were in <strong>UtilsB.hs</strong></li>
    <li>Replaced point and vector arithmetic names with
        operators, based on the names that were in <strong>UtilsB.hs</strong>.
        Added ^+^ and ^-^, although for specific vector space
        types, + and - should be defined as well.</li>
    <li>Added <strong>mouseTrailWords</strong> for making dancing
        word lists in Tutorial.lhs Made <strong>trailWords</strong>
        and <strong>mouseTrailWords</strong> take an explicit
        color argument</li>
    <li>In <strong>ShowImageB.hs</strong>, removed <strong>times</strong>,
        which was motivated by an earlier representation. No more
        <strong>unsafeIntereaveIO</strong>! Also simplified <strong>timeSinceMS</strong>
        a lot, thanks to Alastair. I don't remember why I had the
        complicated version. Made <strong>draw</strong> simpler,
        by not using <strong>times</strong>.</li>
    <li>In <strong>ShowImageB.hs, </strong>added flag <strong>presentation</strong>,
        normally <strong>False</strong>. Make <strong>True</strong>
        for a (e.g., PowerPoint) presentation. Makes the window
        stay on top, but in a corner. Also, resizing the window
        scales the animation.</li>
    <li>In ImageBTest.hs, renamed <strong>viewStretch</strong> to
        <strong>viewStretchBmpFile</strong>, and made it use <strong>viewStretch</strong>
        in UtilsB.hs. The directions self-destruct after three
        seconds.</li>
    <li>Renamed <strong>Pick2Image</strong> module to <strong>PickImage.</strong></li>
    <li>More and corrected <strong>Forceable</strong> instances.</li>
    <li>Decoupled import vs display pixels-per-unit. See <strong>bitmapPixelsPerLengthHorizontal</strong>
        in <strong>Image.hs</strong>, vs <strong>screenPixelsPerLengthHorizontal</strong>
        in <strong>ShowImageB.hs</strong>, and similarly for
        vertical.</li>
    <li>Misc small improvements to <strong>Integral.hs</strong>.
        Better factored now. Removed the scale-by-zero trick,
        moving it outside of the recursion. Switched
        implementation to work more natively at the behavior
        level, removing the explicit lifting in <strong>linearPart</strong>.
        Still does a sampling of the integrand, which it would be
        nice to eliminate somehow.</li>
    <li>Made all <strong>Win32</strong> dependencies explicit
        through qualified import, in preperation for Thomas
        Nordin's GHC green card.</li>
    <li>Noticed that <strong>map</strong> is defined on <strong>IO</strong>.
        Tweaked <strong>viewSize</strong> calculation in <strong>ShowImageB.hs</strong>
        to use <strong>map</strong>. I wonder why <strong>Monad</strong>
        isn't defined as a subclass of <strong>Functor</strong>,
        since IO's definition of map does not seem IO-specific.</li>
</ul>
