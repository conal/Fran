<p align="left">I am tinkering with a new version of <a
href="default.htm">Fran</a>. It's not really ready for general
consumption yet, but in case you're really brave, you can try it
out.</p>

<p align="left">Notes on the new version:</p>

<ul>
    <li>As always, this works with Windows only.</li>
    <li>You'll need DirectX version 3 or better. For NT, this
        means you need NT 4.0 Service Pack 3.</li>
    <li>I changed over the representation of behaviors and events
        to use infinite trees and lists respectively (see
        src/BStack.hs). I'm writing a paper on the representation
        ideas. Unfortunately, this version is overly simplistic
        and ends up tree searching way too much. I'm working on a
        better version.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Unfortunately the performance is still pretty bad, and
        even noticeably worse than before. Fran should be running
        with GHC pretty soon, which should help performance a
        lot, though at the cost of less convenient development.
        Maybe the Fran source code could be improved to get
        acceptable performance under Hugs. Also, there are some
        mysterious space/time leaks. See the comment near the
        bottom of demos\Mover.hs.</li>
</ul>

<p align="left">Directions for trying out this new version:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Grab the zip file <a href="fran1.03.zip">here</a>. It's
        622KB. Extract from the zip file, and you'll get a
        directory called &quot;Fran1&quot;..</li>
    <li>Be sure you have a pretty recent version of <a
        href="http://haskell.systemsz.cs.yale.edu/hugs/">Hugs</a>.
        I'm using 970719.</li>
    <li>Change your Hugs load path, via regedit or by using
        &quot;:set -P&quot; in Hugs, to include
        &quot;..\\src&quot;, before any of the others. Otherwise,
        you'll probably end up loading the version of Fran that
        comes with Hugs.</li>
    <li>Increase your heap size to 1Mb.</li>
    <li>Copy HSpriteLib.dll to a directory on your search %PATH%.</li>
    <li>Start it up. There are a few demos in Fran1\demos,
        notably Mover.hs. See &quot;demo&quot; in that source
        file. As I said above, Fran is rather slow right now.</li>
</ul>
