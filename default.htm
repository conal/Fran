<p>RBMH is now ready for a test drive. It includes support for
simple 2D animation as a Haskell library, and should run on <a
href="http://haskell.systemsz.cs.yale.edu/hugs/">Hugs</a> under
Windows 95 and Windows NT, using Win32 graphics (GDI). </p>

<p>Try it, it's fun! Please let me know how it goes. See <a
href="news.htm">news</a> for details on changes from one version
to another.</p>

<h3>Directions</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Download <a href="http:rbmh0.4.zip"><strong>rbmh0.4.zip</strong></a></li>
    <li>Unzip to create a directory tree called <strong>rbmh</strong>,
        with subdirectories <strong>Media</strong> and <strong>src</strong>. </li>
    <li>Start up Hugs (tested with Yale Release 0), and <strong>:cd</strong>
        to <strong>rbmh\src</strong>. You'll end up in the module
        called <strong>ImageBTest</strong>, which contains simple
        test cases. </li>
    <li>Type <strong>:p rbmh.prj</strong></li>
    <li>At the Hugs prompt, type <strong>disp &lt;name&gt;</strong>,
        where <strong>&lt;name&gt;</strong> is <strong>i1</strong>, <strong>i2</strong>,
        etc, as defined in <strong>ImageBTest.hs</strong>. (For i17,
        you'll need to say <strong>(i17 0)</strong> ). There are very
        sparse comments in the source. </li>
    <li>Try examples of your own. If you send me ones you've
        built, I'll consider them for inclusion (with credit to
        you) in future releases. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Represents alpha behaviors as <strong>[Time] -&gt;
        [alpha]</strong>. This form allows incremental behavior
        evaluation without implicit state, in particular for <strong>untilB</strong>
        and <strong>integral</strong> behaviors. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugs</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Button-up and key-up events are missed if they happen too
        soon after the down event. Be careful with <strong>i8,
        i9, i10, i11</strong> in <strong>ImageBTest.</strong> If
        an up-event goes unnoticed, do the <em>same</em> down
        event again, but this time hold for a bit and release.</li>
    <li>Transformation doesn't work on all primitives. In
        particular: bitmaps, and text don't rotate, and text
        doesn't even scale. <strong>SetWorldTransform</strong>
        might be a general fix, but from the documentation, it
        doesn't appear to work under Win95. </li>
    <li><strong>ImageBTest.iBlowStack</strong> blows the stack.
        In general, it seems that infinitely recursive image
        behaviors blow the stack, even with bounding boxes. I
        guess there's a subtlety about strictness that I don't
        grok yet.</li>
    <li>Text doesn't center. </li>
    <li>Examples <strong>i9</strong> and <strong>i10</strong>
        don't hear the button release if you do it too soon after
        the button press.</li>
    <li>Switch all <strong>ImageBTest</strong> examples to be
        functions of start time, to eliminate space leak (CAFs)
        and to make them temporally composable.</li>
</ul>
