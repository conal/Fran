This repository contains versions of RBMH/Fran, ("Functional reactive animation") from 1996 to 2002. I renamed "RBMH" ("Reactive behavior modeling in Haskell") to "Fran" at Paul Hudak's suggestion in 1997.

Some relevant links:

*   [*A Brief Introduction to ActiveVRML*]: Describes the first version of FRP, before I found Haskell.
*   TBAG (immediate predecessor to Fran/FRP):
    *   [*TBAG: A High Level Framework for Interactive, Animated 3D Graphics Applications*]
    *   [*Functional 3D Graphics in C++ — with an Object-Oriented, Multiple Dispatching Implementation.*]
*   [My publications](http://conal.net/papers/), including several on FRP/Fran, including on some of the implementation techniques I explored in this repository.

New project capturing early Fran/FRP implementations. Thanks to [@deepfire](https://github.com/deepfire) for the inspiration to make these implementations easily available.
