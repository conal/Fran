-- Vector spaces
-- 
-- Doesn't work as well as we'd like.  Lacking type relations, we have to
-- hardwire the scalar type, which means we can't use behaviors, so we
-- can't lift a VectorSpace instance into another one.
--
-- When we do have type relations, introduce an AffineSpace class as well
-- and make Point2, Point3, Point2B, and Point3B be instances.

{- Does this make sense?  I get "Illegal type expression" 
  Yes it makes perfect sense to me, but Haskell type classes does
  not allow you to do this (:-(), i.e., declaring default methods for
  instances of some class. Instance decls. work over type
  constructors, hence the msg. 

  In this case, the soln. is to give VectorSpace decls. for all
  the Floating instances (not extensible)...sigh.
