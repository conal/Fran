- In ../, do "make staticTest", and make sure there are no errors.  Then
  run a few tests.  Tutorial is a good general one.

- Update news.htm, if it's fallen behind.  My practice is to make comments
  when I check in files, and then, just before a release, get a history
  since the last release, and organize the results into a new news.htm
  entry.

- If any any source files have been added to SpriteLib, or project
  settings changed, then in SpriteLib, check out SpriteLib.mak, open the
  project the Visual C++, go to the Project menu and select "Export
  Makefile".  (Enables automated build of SpriteLib, which is seldom
  necessary.)

- Update default.htm.  Change the version number, date and download link.
  Save.

- Do a recursive SourceSafe check-in at the Fran level.

- Do a SourceSafe "get" to a directory ToZip\Fran, where ToZip is empty,
  selecting "recursive", "writable", "build tree", and setting the file
  dates to "modified", in the advanced controls for "get" (if not already
  set as the VSS default).

- SpriteLib sometimes gets excluded, and I'm stumped as to why.  Check to
  make sure it's there, and if not, get it (recursively and writable)
  explicitly to ToZip\Fran\SpriteLib.  (The "build tree" option in
  recursive get avoids the problem.)

- Delete any files from ToZip\Fran that should not go into the release.
  Currently none.

- Make a new file, like "Fran1.10.zip" in ToZip; open it with WinZip; hit
  the "Add" button, change the directory to the ToZip one you just made,
  and do a recursive wildcard add.

- Move the new zip file to my fran/Zips web directory, and delete the
  ToZip/Fran subtree.

- Do a SourceSafe "get" on docs to my fran web directory.

- Verify that it works, by following the link from my external web page:
  http://www.research.microsoft.com/~conal/fran/docs.

- Assuming it works, do a SourceSafe "label" to the Fran project.

- Put out the word.
