- In ../, do "make staticTest", and make sure there are no errors.  Then
  run a few tests.  Tutorial is a good general one.

- Update news.htm, if it's fallen behind.  My practice is to make comments
  when I check in files, and then, just before a release, get a history
  since the last release, and organize the results into a new news.htm
  entry.

- If any any source files have been added to SpriteLib, or project
  settings changed, then in SpriteLib, check out SpriteLib.mak, open the
  project the Visual C++, go to the Project menu and select "Export
  Makefile".  (Enables automated build of SpriteLib, which is seldom
  necessary.)

- Update default.htm.  Change the version number, date and download link.
  Save.

- Do a recursive SourceSafe check-in at the Fran level.

- Do a recursive SourceSafe "get" to a directory ToZip\Fran, selecting
  "writable", and setting the file dates to "modified", in the advanced
  controls for "get".

- Delete any files from ToZip\Fran that should not go into the release.
  Currently none.

- Copy Fran\SpriteLib\Debug\SpriteLib.dll to ToZip\Fran, and src\HSpriteLib.dll
  and src\HSpriteLib.hs to ToZip\Fran\src.

- Make a new file, like "Fran1.1.zip" in ToZip; open it; and do a
  recursive wildcard add.

- Move the new zip file to my fran/Zips web directory, and delete the
  ToZip/Fran subtree.

- Do a SourceSafe "get" on docs to my fran web directory.

- Verify that it works, by following the link from my external web page:
  http://www.research.microsoft.com/~conal/fran/docs.

- Assuming it works, do a SourceSafe "label" to the Fran project.

- Put out the word.
