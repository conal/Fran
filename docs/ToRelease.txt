- If any any source files have been added to SpriteLib, or project
  settings changed, then in SpriteLib, check out SpriteLib.mak, open the
  project the Visual C++, go to the Project menu and select "Export
  Makefile".  Then edit SpriteLib.mak, find the line that says "copy
  Debug\SpriteLib.dll %windir%", and add another "%" on the end, (why?!),
  and check it in.  (Enables automated build of SpriteLib, which is
  usually unnecessary.)

- Update newFran.htm.  Change the version number, date and download link.
  Save.

- Do a recursive SourceSafe check-in at the Fran1 level.

- Do a recursive SourceSafe "get" to a directory ToZip\Fran1, selecting
  "writable", and setting the file dates to "modified", in the advanced
  controls for "get".

- Delete any files from ToZip\Fran1 that should not go into the release.
  Currently none.

- Copy Fran1\SpriteLib\Debug\SpriteLib.dll to Fran1, and gc\HSpriteLib.dll
  and gc\HSpriteLib.hs to ToZip\Fran1\gc.

- Make a new file, like "Fran1.04.zip" in ToZip; open it; and do a
  recursive wildcard add.

- Copy the new zip file and ToZip\Fran1\*.htm and *.gif to my fran web
  directory.

- Verify that it works, by following the link from my external web page:
  http://www.research.microsoft.com/~conal/fran. 

- Assuming it works, do a SourceSafe "label" to the Fran project.

- Put out the word.
