<p>Fran is a Haskell library (or &quot;embedded language&quot;) for interactive animations
with 2D and 3D graphics and sound. It runs on <a
HREF="http://haskell.systemsz.cs.yale.edu/hugs/">Hugs version 1.4</a>, which is very easy
to install.&nbsp; In fact Fran 1.09 is built into Hugs 1.4.&nbsp; Fran 1.10 is released
separately from Hugs, and may be found <a href="Zips/Fran1.1.zip">here</a>.</p>

<p>See <a HREF="news.htm">news</a> for details on changes from one version to another, and
links zip files for all released versions.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Fran works with Windows only. You'll need <a HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/directx">DirectX</a>
    version 3 or better. For NT, this means you need NT 4.0 with <a
    HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/NT4SP3_I.EXE">Service pack 3</a>.
    My plan for Unix, etc., is to wait until DirectX is running there (which is in the works).
  </li>
  <li>Check out the <a HREF="http://www.research.microsoft.com/~conal/fran/tutorial.htm">tutorial</a>
    and <a HREF="http:UsersMan.htm">User's Manual</a>. (The tutorial has lots of animated GIFs
    totalling 2Mb. Please be patient. You might want to download the <a
    HREF="http://www.research.microsoft.com/~conal/fran/tutorialArticle.zip">zip file</a> and
    view it locally.) </li>
  <li>The <b>demos</b> directory has -- guess what? -- demos! See <a HREF="demos.txt">demos.txt</a>.
  </li>
  <li>The garbage collector interferes with smooth performance. After Hugs and <a
    HREF="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/fp/software/ghc/">GHC</a> are merged, this problem should
    not be noticeable. </li>
  <li>As of very recently, Fran works with <a HREF="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/fp/software/ghc/">GHC</a>.
    Performance is <b>much</b> better. Installation is somewhat painful, but that situation is
    improving. If you're interested, see <a HREF="HowToGHC.txt">HowToGHC.txt</a>. Well, there
    are a few missing pieces, related to GreenCard, so you'd better wait.</li>
  <li>Try examples of your own. If you send me ones you've built, I'll consider them for
    inclusion (with credit to you) in future releases.</li>
  <li>If you're installing from a zip file, rename your Hugs/lib/Fran to &quot;FranWas&quot;
    (for instance), and unzip into Hugs/lib.&nbsp; Then rename Hugs/SpriteLib.dll to
    SpriteLibWas.dll, and manually copy the new Hugs/lib/Fran/SpriteLib.dll into Hugs/. &nbsp;
    Then try it out.</li>
  <li>In any case, please <a HREF="mailto:conal@microsoft.com">let me know</a> about your
    experience.</li>

  <li>Greg Schechter, Ricky Yeung, Salim AbiEzzi, and I collaborated at Sun Microsystems on <a
    HREF="http://www.research.microsoft.com/research/graphics/elliott/tbag/index.htm">TBAG</a>,
    a system for constraint-based, semi-declarative modeling of 3D animation. Some of the Fran
    ideas were initially explored there. </li>
  <li><a HREF="http://www.research.microsoft.com/research/graphics/knoblock/">Todd Knoblock</a>
    and Jim Kajiya helped to explore the basic ideas of behaviors and events. </li>
  <li><a HREF="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~sof">Sigbjorn Finne</a> helped a lot with the
    implementation during his summer '96 internship. Since then, he has been <i><b>very</b></i>
    helpful with getting getting Fran and GHC ready for each other. </li>
  <li><a HREF="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~acd/">Tony Daniels</a> has been pushing the limits of
    physics-oriented reactive behavior, uncovering some limitations in the implementation. He
    also collaborated on some ideas for efficient behavior representation. </li>
  <li><a HREF="http://www.cs.yale.edu/HTML/YALE/CS/HyPlans/hudak-paul.html">Paul Hudak</a> has
    been collaborating on the ideas and, in particular, how to embed them in Haskell. </li>
  <li><a HREF="http://www.cs.yale.edu/HTML/YALE/CS/HyPlans/reid-alastair.html">Alastair Reid</a>
    answered lots of my naive questions about Haskell and its implementation, and provided
    some emergency Hugs hacking. He also made very helpful pass through version 0.8, updating
    it to a newer Hugs version, and making various improvements, and rewriting interaction
    code to be much simpler. </li>
  <li><a HREF="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/peterson-john.html">John Peterson</a> wrote
    another implementation that provided an interesting comparison. Many interesting
    discussions. With Gary Shu Ling and me, wrote the Fran User's guide. </li>
  <li><a HREF="http://www.cs.yale.edu/users/ling/">Gary Shu Ling</a> found misc bugs and
    sources of incompleteness. He also helped out quite a lot with the Fran 1.05 during a Fall
    '97 internship, and developed the Sokoban demo. </li>
  <li><a HREF="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~simonpj/">Simon Peyton Jones</a> is helping me
    understand <a HREF="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/fp/software/ghc/">GHC</a> (the Glasgow
    Haskell compiler) and how to use it effectively to compiler animation programs, as well as
    how to better implement Fran. </li>
  <li><a HREF="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/Department/Staff/mpj/">Mark Jones</a> has been helping
    me understand Haskell type classes and how to use them well in Fran. </li>
  <li><a HREF="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~wadler/">Philip Wadler</a> had provided interesting
    and insightful feedback on the semantics of behaviors and events. </li>
  <li><a HREF="http://www.oz.net/~conal/Jake.html">Jake Elliott</a> did the artwork for
    Sokoban. </li>
