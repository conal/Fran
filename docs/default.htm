</EM><P>Fran is a Haskell library (or "embedded language") for interactive animations with 2D and 3D graphics and sound. It runs on <A HREF="http://haskell.systemsz.cs.yale.edu/hugs/">Hugs version 1.4</A>, and recently <A HREF="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/fp/software/ghc/">GHC 2.09</A>, under Windows 95 and Windows NT, using DirectX. </P>
<P>See <A HREF="news.htm">news</A> for details on changes from one version to another.</P>
<H3>Notes</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Fran works with Windows only. You'll need <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/directx">DirectX</A> version 3 or better. For NT, this means you need NT 4.0 with <A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/NT4SP3_I.EXE">Service pack 3</A>. My plan for Unix, etc., is to wait until DirectX is running there (which is in the works). </LI>
<LI>Check out the <A HREF="http://www.research.microsoft.com/~conal/fran/tutorial.htm">tutorial</A> and <A HREF="http:UsersMan.htm">User's Manual</A>. (The tutorial has lots of animated GIFs totalling 2.7Mb. Please be patient. You might want to download the <A HREF="http://www.research.microsoft.com/~conal/fran/tutorialArticle.zip">zip file</A> and view it locally.) </LI>
<LI>For Fran, Hugs needs a bigger heap than the default of 100K. Say ":set -h1Mb" once and then ":q" to quit. Hugs will start using the bigger heap size thereafter. </LI>
<LI>The <B>demos</B> directory has -- guess what? -- demos! See <A HREF="demos/ReadMe.txt"><B>demos\ReadMe.txt</B></A> </LI>
<LI>The garbage collector interferes with smooth performance. After Hugs and <A HREF="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/fp/software/ghc/">GHC</A> are merged, this problem should not be noticeable. </LI>
<LI>As of very recently, Fran works with <A HREF="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/fp/software/ghc/">GHC</A>. Performance is <B>much</B> better. If you're feeling brave, see <A HREF="docs/HowToGHC.txt"><B>docs\HowToGHC.txt</B></A>. </LI>
<LI>Try examples of your own. If you send me ones you've built, I'll consider them for inclusion (with credit to you) in future releases. </LI>
<LI>In any case, please <A HREF="mailto:conal@microsoft.com">let me know</A> about your experience.</LI></UL>

<LI>Greg Schechter, Ricky Yeung, Salim AbiEzzi, and I collaborated at Sun Microsystems on <A HREF="http://www.research.microsoft.com/research/graphics/elliott/tbag/index.htm">TBAG</A>, a system for constraint-based, semi-declarative modeling of 3D animation. Some of the Fran ideas were initially explored there. </LI>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.research.microsoft.com/research/graphics/knoblock/">Todd Knoblock</A> and Jim Kajiya helped to explore the basic ideas of behaviors and events. </LI>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~sof">Sigbjorn Finne</A> helped a lot with the implementation during his summer '96 internship. Since then, he has been <B><I>very</B></I> helpful with getting getting Fran and GHC ready for each other. </LI>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~acd/">Tony Daniels</A> has been pushing the limits of physics-oriented reactive behavior, uncovering some limitations in the implementation. He also collaborated on some ideas for efficient behavior representation. </LI>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.cs.yale.edu/HTML/YALE/CS/HyPlans/hudak-paul.html">Paul Hudak</A> has been collaborating on the ideas and, in particular, how to embed them in Haskell. </LI>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.cs.yale.edu/HTML/YALE/CS/HyPlans/reid-alastair.html">Alastair Reid</A> answered lots of my naive questions about Haskell and its implementation, and provided some emergency Hugs hacking. He also made very helpful pass through version 0.8, updating it to a newer Hugs version, and making various improvements, and rewriting interaction code to be much simpler. </LI>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/peterson-john.html">John Peterson</A> wrote another implementation that provided an interesting comparison. Many interesting discussions. With Gary Shu Ling and me, wrote the Fran User's guide. </LI>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.cs.yale.edu/users/ling/">Gary Shu Ling</A> found misc bugs and sources of incompleteness. He also helped out quite a lot with the Fran 1.05 during a Fall '97 internship, and developed the Sokoban demo. </LI>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~simonpj/">Simon Peyton Jones</A> is helping me understand <A HREF="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/fp/software/ghc/">GHC</A> (the Glasgow Haskell compiler) and how to use it effectively to compiler animation programs, as well as how to better implement Fran. </LI>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/Department/Staff/mpj/">Mark Jones</A> has been helping me understand Haskell type classes and how to use them well in Fran. </LI>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~wadler/">Philip Wadler</A> had provided interesting and insightful feedback on the semantics of behaviors and events. </LI>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.oz.net/~conal/Jake.html">Jake Elliott</A> did the artwork for Sokoban. </LI></UL>
