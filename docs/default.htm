<p><font size="4"><em>Note: The new Fran with 3D and sound is </em><em><u>almost</u></em><em>,
but not quite, ready for use, because it depends on an unreleased
version of Hugs. Please check back here later, or let me know
you're interested, and I'll email you when Hugs and Fran are
ready. Meanwhile, an older version of Fran is distributed with
Hugs (see link below).</em></font></p>

<p>Fran is a Haskell library (or &quot;embedded language&quot;)
for interactive animations with 2D and 3D graphics and sound. It
runs on <a href="http://haskell.systemsz.cs.yale.edu/hugs/">Hugs
version 1.4</a> under Windows 95 and Windows NT, using DirectX. </p>

<p>Try it, it's fun! Please let me know how it goes.</p>

<p>See <a href="news.htm">news</a> for details on changes from
one version to another.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Fran works with Windows only. You'll need <a
        href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx">DirectX</a>
        version 3 or better. For NT, this means you need NT 4.0
        with <a
        href="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/NT4SP3_I.EXE">Service
        pack 3</a>. My plan for Unix, etc., is to wait until
        DirectX is running there (which is in the works). </li>
    <li>For Fran, Hugs needs a bigger heap than the default of
        100K. Say &quot;:set -h1Mb&quot; once and then
        &quot;:q&quot; to quit. Hugs will start using the bigger
        heap size thereafter.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Directions</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Download <a href="Fran1.06.zip">Fran1.06.zip</a></li>
    <li>Unzip to create a directory tree called <strong>Fran</strong>,
        with subdirectories <strong>demos</strong>, <strong>gc</strong>,
        <strong>media</strong>, <strong>SpriteLib</strong>, and <strong>src</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>In <em>Windows Explorer</em>, double click on <strong>Tutorial.hs</strong>
        in <strong>Fran\demos</strong>. If your Hugs is set up
        properly, it should start up, load a bunch of modules and
        put up a graphics window. (If double-clicking <strong>Tutorial.hs</strong>
        didn't work for you, then instead, start up Hugs, and <strong>:cd</strong>
        to <strong>Fran\demos</strong>. Type <strong>:l Tutorial</strong>.
        Lots of modules will then get loaded. At the Hugs prompt
        (should be in module <strong>Tutorial</strong>), type <strong>main</strong>.)
    </li>
    <li>Press space, &quot;<strong>n</strong>&quot;, or
        right-arrow to advance to the next animation, and &quot;<strong>p</strong>&quot;
        or left-arrow to back up to previous one.</li>
    <li>Try more demos. See <strong>Sokoban3\SokoDemo.hs</strong>
        and <strong>Mover.hs</strong>.</li>
    <li>Try examples of your own. If you send me ones you've
        built, I'll consider them for inclusion (with credit to
        you) in future releases. </li>
    <li>In any case, please <a href="mailto:conal@microsoft.com">let
        me know</a> about your experience.</li>
</ol>

<h3>&nbsp;Credits</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Greg Schechter, Ricky Yeung, Salim AbiEzzi, and I
        collaborated at Sun Microsystems on <a
        href="http://www.research.microsoft.com/research/graphics/elliott/tbag/index.htm">TBAG</a>,
        a system for constraint-based, semi-declarative modeling
        of 3D animation. Some of the Fran ideas were initially
        explored there. </li>
    <li><a
        href="http://www.research.microsoft.com/research/graphics/knoblock/">Todd
        Knoblock</a> and Jim Kajiya helped to explore the basic
        ideas of behaviors and events. </li>
    <li><a href="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~sof">Sigbjorn Finne</a>
        helped a lot with the implementation during his summer
        '96 internship. Since then, he has been very helpful with
        getting getting Fran and GHC ready for each other. </li>
    <li><a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~acd/">Tony Daniels</a>
        has been pushing the limits of physics-oriented reactive
        behavior, uncovering some limitations in the
        implementation. He also collaborated on some ideas for
        efficient behavior representation. </li>
    <li><a
        href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/HTML/YALE/CS/HyPlans/hudak-paul.html">Paul
        Hudak</a> has been collaborating on the ideas and, in
        particular, how to embed them in Haskell. </li>
    <li><a
        href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/HTML/YALE/CS/HyPlans/reid-alastair.html">Alastair
        Reid</a> answered lots of my naive questions about
        Haskell and its implementation, and provided some
        emergency Hugs hacking. He also made very helpful pass
        through version 0.8, updating it to a newer Hugs version,
        and making various improvements, and rewriting
        interaction code to be much simpler. </li>
    <li><a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/peterson-john.html">John
        Peterson</a> wrote another implementation that provided
        an interesting comparison. Many interesting discussions.
        With Gary Shu Ling, wrote the Fran User's guide. </li>
    <li><a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/users/ling/">Gary Shu
        Ling</a> found misc bugs and sources of incompleteness.
        He also helped out quite a lot with the Fran 1.05 during
        a Fall '97 internship, and developed the Sokoban demo. </li>
    <li><a href="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~simonpj/">Simon Peyton
        Jones</a> is helping me understand <a
        href="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/fp/software/ghc/">GHC</a>
        (the Glasgow Haskell compiler) and how to use it
        effectively to compiler animation programs, as well as
        how to better implement Fran. </li>
    <li><a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/Department/Staff/mpj/">Mark
        Jones</a> has been helping me understand Haskell type
        classes and how to use them well in Fran. </li>
    <li><a href="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~wadler/">Philip Wadler</a>
        had provided interesting and insightful feedback on the
        semantics of behaviors and events. </li>
    <li><a href="http://www.oz.net/~conal/Jake.html">Jake Elliott</a>
        did the artwork for Sokoban.</li>
