Under the demos directory you'll find a random assortment of Fran demos.
Each has a "main" and so can be started either with hugs.exe, typing
"main" to the prompt, or with runhugs.exe, in which case there will be no
prompt.  Here is a brief description

 Test: For my own testing, but contains some nice ones.  Check out
 crop4 and move the mouse around.

 Tutorial: Examples used in the Fran tutorial.  See the file for a web
 pointer, which has lots of animated GIFs.  Step forward through the
 examples with space, right arrow, or "n".  Step backward with left arrow
 or "p".

 SpiroKids: Well, it's just weird.  Try it out!  You may want to adjust
 numKids to suit your machine's performance.

 UsersMan: Goes with the users manual.  See ..\docs\UsersMan.htm.

 Mover.hs: The Fifteen puzzle.  If you delve some, you'll discover several
 mix-and-match variations.

 Sokoban\SokoMain: The classic game of Sokoban.  Try to push the gold ball
 into the black holders.  Really too slow to be fun yet.

 Roids\MainRoids: A start at an Asteroids game.  Much still to be done.

 CurveEditor\Editor[0-6]: An interactive curve editor.  This example
 illustrates event-oriented programming and is described in an upcoming
 paper.
